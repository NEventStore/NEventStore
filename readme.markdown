NEventStore
===

NEventStore is a persistence library used to abstract different storage implementations when using event sourcing as storage mechanism. 

This library is developed with a specific focus on [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)/[CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_query_responsibility_segregation) applications.

NEventStore currently supports:

- .net standard 2.0
- .net framework 4.6.2

Starting from Version 6.0.0 NEventStore will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to track the version numbers.
