- Utilize triggers for SQL persistence to simplify EventStore code and to leverage RDBMS capabilities.
  a) [DONE] Triggers would be used to insert into the Dispatch table and update the Streams table.
  b) [1/2 DONE] Triggers would prevent updating rows in the Commits table, except for the Snapshot column.
  c) [1/2 DONE] Updating the Snapshot column of Commits table would result in Snapshot column of Streams table being updated, if necessary.

- Ensure SQL statements from the dynamic SQL adapter: SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED
- Ensure SQL statements from the dynamic SQL adapter: BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION
- Potentially use stored procedures (or some variant) to make SqlPersistence code fully database agnostic.

- Create fluent configuration code leveraging an IoC container.
